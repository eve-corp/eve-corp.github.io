### Custom Application Development
#### > Software that's created for you

Here's a tip:  You are better off buying existing software.  If you can find a product that meets your needs, use that instead -- seriously.

However, sometimes custom software can be the best thing for your business.  It might be right choice if...

* **You have a solid process in place and want to increase throughput.**  
Say goobye to paper and everything that comes with it, like limited access to decisions, long turn-around times, lack of accountability, human mistakes, etc.

* **You want different applications to talk to one another.**  
You absolutely love your time keeping system, but if only it could talk to payroll...

* **You spend too much time creating and formatting reports.**  
Imagine if you could go home 30 minutes earlier every Friday instead of merging all those daily reports into a weekly report.

* **You want to move data.**  
You just started with a new order management system and need to import large quantities of data from excel files.  Or maybe you need to automatically transmit data to a third party, such as for state reporting.

* **You have a niche need.**  
You want to transform data from your DNA machines into something human-readable and 100% accurate.  (We've done that.)

* **You already have a custom system and want to upgrade it.**  
You wish your system would automatically email you when an order was canceled.  Or maybe your server infrastructure is stuck at Server 2003 because your software isn't compatible. Or maybe you had a bad experience with a previous vendor and need things cleaned up (this last one makes us sad).


Still not sure?  We can help you decide.

### Our Philosophy

We believe that you know your job best and that we can work together to help you do your job better.

We have experience in both the private and public sectors covering topics such as health care, judicial systems, and school transportation.  What's more, is we LOVE learning about what you do and addressing the problems you're facing head-on.

When working with our customers, we believe that communication is vital and we make every effort to keep you informed.  For this reason, we opt for an Agile approach such as Scrum or Kanban.

We take an iterative approach so that you can see progress along the way, and you also have opportunity to adjust course as needed.  We also back our development with automated tests to ensure that we avoid the "well it worked last week" syndrome.


### Our Tools

We are most comfortable with Microsoft and related web technologies.  [See the full list.](tools)
